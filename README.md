# Power-BI
## Introduction
Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool developed by Microsoft that allows users to visualize and analyze data from various sources. It provides a range of features and capabilities for creating interactive reports and dashboards. One important aspect of Power BI is its integration with Git, a popular version control system. This integration enables users to manage their Power BI projects efficiently and collaborate with team members effectively. In this README, we will explore the key features of Power BI and its integration with Git.

### Key Features of Power BI
- Data Visualization: Power BI offers a wide range of visualizations such as charts, graphs, maps, and tables to help users present their data effectively. It allows users to create interactive and dynamic reports that can be explored and analyzed in real-time.

- Data Connectivity: Power BI supports a vast array of data connectors, enabling users to connect to various data sources, including databases, Excel files, cloud services, and more. This flexibility allows users to access and combine data from different sources to gain comprehensive insights.

- Data Modeling: Power BI provides capabilities for data modeling, allowing users to shape and transform their data to suit their analysis requirements. Users can create relationships between tables, define calculated columns and measures, and perform advanced data transformations using Power Query.

- DAX Language: Power BI utilizes the Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language, which is a formula language similar to Excel formulas. DAX allows users to create custom calculations, define business logic, and perform advanced calculations on their data.

- Power Query: Power Query is a powerful data transformation and query tool integrated into Power BI. It enables users to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources and apply transformations to clean and shape the data before loading it into Power BI.

- Collaboration and Sharing: Power BI offers collaboration features that enable users to share reports and dashboards with others. Users can work together on the same report, make real-time updates, and provide feedback through comments. Power BI also provides security controls to manage access and permissions for shared content.
